		%Add your comments here.
		Note: in our review we consider '***' as the best score and '*' as the worst score.
		
		Code:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The LR and NB models experiment graphs are not showing correctly.
			\item The variable names are relatively easy to understand, they are mostly shortened form of a term or convention, but not always.
			\item The documentation is good. Without it, it would have taken much longer to understand what each line suppose to do (especially for people that are new to python).
		\end{itemize}
	
		Report:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item It's really impressive that team 24 have looked at the data and decided what is relevant to their problem and to the methods that they want to use and what data is not relevant or could potentially harm their results. Shows very good understanding of the topic. 
		\item Data extraction and manipulation is explained very thoroughly and in an understandable manner.
		\item The data visualization is very helpful to the reader in understanding the data-set. Good idea.
		\end{itemize}
